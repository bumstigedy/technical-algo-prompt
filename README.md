# Algorithmic Trading with Technical Analysis using chatGPT

This project was completed to learn about technical analysis, algorithmic trading, and coding with AI. Implementing some algorithmic strategies using technical indicators helped me better understand them and allowed me to experiment with linking multiple indicators to chase high returns with low drawdowns.

## Project Overview

Included in this repository are a few simple examples to illustrate the concepts. I hope you'll enjoy tweaking your own strategies as much as I did!

### Repository Structure

- **my_strategies.py**: Contains the trading strategies.
- **get_data.py**: A simple function to extract price data from Yahoo Finance.
- **prompts.md**: Contains the ChatGPT prompts used to generate the code.
- **backtesting.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook where the backtesting of strategies is executed.
- **MACD_plot.html**: An example chart generated by backtesting.py.
- **RSI_plot.html**: An example chart generated by backtesting.py.
- **HODL.txt**: A file with Bitcoin HODL wave peaks; used to illustrate incorporatoin of macro, fundamental, or other non price data. (https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/hodl-waves/)

### Tools and Libraries

- **[backtesting.py](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4ytbIm2Xg0&list=PLnSVMZC68_e48lA4aRYL1yHYZ9nEq9AiH)**: Chosen for its simplicity, this library was used for backtesting the strategies.  It also generates amazing charts showing the trades, entries/exits, indicators used, and the equity curve.  
- **[TA-Lib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZIZMMcTQ8c)**: Used for the technical indicators. Note that installing TA-Lib requires a bit of extra work—watch the video linked for guidance.

### Prompts

The `prompts.md` file contains the prompts I used to write the strategies. It's pretty cool that we can turn English into code so easily! These are the final versions after some tweaking. For example, the first time I wrote the prompt for the RSI strategy, the code used `self.sell` instead of `self.position.close` to close the position, which didn’t produce the desired results. After informing ChatGPT, it rewrote the code correctly.

## Learning Experience

My experience with this project was that AI was a fast and efficient way to write the code. I hope this repository serves as a helpful resource for your own learning and experimentation.
